# servo_motor_arduino
A Servo Motor is a small device that has an output shaft. This shaft can be positioned to specific angular positions by sending the servo a coded signal. As long as the coded signal exists on the input line, the servo will maintain the angular position of the shaft.
Servo motors were first used in the Remote Control (RC) world, usually to control the steering of RC cars or the flaps on a RC plane.
